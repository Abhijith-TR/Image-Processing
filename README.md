*Proposal*
>1) *Image Processing using Verilog*
>2) *Fast Fourier Transform using Verilog*






### Fast Fourier Trasnform
Fast fourier transform is one of the most important algorithms created in the last century. Much of the modern technology such as wireless communication, GPS or infact anything related to the vast field of signal processing relies on the insights of FFT.

### Why FFT?
FFT saves large amounts of execution time as conventional linear algebra evaluation of Fourier Transform (DFT Algorithm) is an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms where n is the number of data points (may range from 1 Million to 1 Billion in real world signals) where as FFT is an O(nlog(n)) algorithm. Thus FFT is an almost linear algorithm in FFT.
