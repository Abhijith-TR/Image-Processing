## Progress
- [x] Implemented a MATLAB script to convert a given bitmap image to hexadecimal format as verilog can't process images directly rather we perform operations on the matrix associated with the image using verilog.
- [x] Identified the module inputs and outputs.

## In Progress
- [ ] Verilog module to perform operation on image matrix to convert it to image matrix for corresponding greyscale image.
- [ ] MATLAB script to view the produced output hex file as humans can't percieve the produced hexadecimal file.
